iOS Auth App
=============

This is an IOS app, created in studio using the initial IOS app template.  The code in AppDelegate.m performs an auth call when the app is launched.  Keep an eye on the console to see if the auth call succeeded or failed.

Use this app as a reference if you have problems checking if your IOS app has trouble performing an auth call.
